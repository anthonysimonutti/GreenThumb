# Green Thumb Network
Green Thumb Network includes the client and server connections for the Green Thumb project.
Clients will receive plant growth information and send that data quickly to the server to be inserted
into the database. The server will handle multiple connections at once (currently coded for 4) and input
data quickly into the database for use by regression modeling and front end displays.

client directory
  clientClass.py
    - Contains all the meat of the client.
    - ipClient() creates a client object to hold all connection info
    - Includes main functions to connect, authenticate, send, and receive messages with the server.
  testClient.py
    - Test client for the IP project, tests 100 input datasets with a second in between each input
    - Client usage "python clientTest.py <config.json> <testdataset.json>"
    - config.json contains server information clientId, serverAddr, serverPort, and serverKey
      - clientId is a unique identifier to indicate which client we are, used as the key in the database
      - serverAddr is the server address.
      - serverPort is the port of the server.
      - serverKey is a key from the server used to authenticate into the server.
    - Client connects to server based on config file info
    - Sends the serverKey first and expects an "authenticatesuccess" response
    - Once authenticated we start sending each line of the json test dataset to be input into the database

server directory
  server.py
    - Creates and upkeeps the server that clients connect to.
    - When a client connects we create a new thread to handle the new client.
    - Each thread pushes client input to the queue that is shared by each thread.
    - The aggregate thread then consumes each item off the queue to insert into the database.
    - When clients disconnect we cleanly close the thread so we don't end up with zombie threads.
    - Included a disconnect command to close all threads at once.
